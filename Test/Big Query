Write a big query as per below description

I have a transaction table fields account number and amount column and PTP agreement table fields account number and remaining amount and PTP id and PTP agreement table fields PTP id and account number and total amount so based on transaction amount need to update amount column in PTP aggreement table and PTP assignment table example 3000 transaction amount and if transaction is > PTP agreement table amount (1500)and PTP arrangement table PTP amount column (1500) need to subtract and remaining 1500 amount against substrate from next record so similarly if 2 transaction records for same account number need to subtract all two transactions amount from all PTP amount from agreement table and assignment table

-- Step 1: Sum total transaction amounts per account
WITH transaction_summary AS (
  SELECT
    account_number,
    SUM(amount) AS total_transaction_amount
  FROM
    transaction_table
  GROUP BY
    account_number
),

-- Step 2: Compute how much to deduct from ptp_agreement_table
ptp_agreement_update AS (
  SELECT
    p.ptp_id,
    p.account_number,
    p.remaining_amount,
    LEAST(p.remaining_amount, t.total_transaction_amount) AS amount_to_deduct,
    -- remaining transaction amount after deduction
    GREATEST(t.total_transaction_amount - p.remaining_amount, 0) AS remaining_txn_after_agreement
  FROM
    ptp_agreement_table p
  JOIN
    transaction_summary t
  ON
    p.account_number = t.account_number
),

-- Step 3: Compute how much to deduct from ptp_assignment_table using the remaining amount
ptp_assignment_update AS (
  SELECT
    pa.ptp_id,
    pa.account_number,
    pa.total_amount,
    LEAST(pa.total_amount, a.remaining_txn_after_agreement) AS amount_to_deduct
  FROM
    ptp_assignment_table pa
  JOIN
    ptp_agreement_update a
  ON
    pa.ptp_id = a.ptp_id
)

-- Final Select to show the updates
SELECT
  'ptp_agreement_table' AS table_name,
  ptp_id,
  account_number,
  remaining_amount AS original_amount,
  remaining_amount - amount_to_deduct AS updated_amount
FROM
  ptp_agreement_update

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'ptp_assignment_table' AS table_name,
  ptp_id,
  account_number,
  total_amount AS original_amount,
  total_amount - amount_to_deduct AS updated_amount
FROM
  ptp_assignment_update;
